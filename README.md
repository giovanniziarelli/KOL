The source code for **DOI ARCHIVE**

##
The repository is organized as follows:
- `src`: folder containing sources for training KOl-m and KOL- $\partial$
- Other folders gathering results presented in the paper.

In particular:

`u_opt_KOL_#`: folders containing results of optimal controls of the quadratic OC problem with different values of the regularization constant

`results_ocQuadratic_cu`: folder containing results for the solution of a quadratic optimal control problem for minimizing infected

`sensitivity_kernels`: folder containing results concerning the kernel-selection process for KOL

`minimum_eradication_time`: folder containing results of the optimal control problem for determining the minimum eradication time
